              Radicle Explorer is an open-source web application that anyone can deploy on their
              own. To ensure its success and usability, it is crucial that the design is consistent,
              easy to extend, and low maintenance.

              After carefully auditing the current UI and its patterns, I developed a color system,
              a typographic scale, and components in Figma.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once all stakeholders agreed I created the pipeline to export and transform tokens
              into stylesheets and implemented these in the Svelte front end.

        <p>
          Selecting a harmonious set of base colors limits the palette to a manageable number while
          providing enough flexibility to address new and unforeseen use cases. Contributors can be
          confident that any two colors will work well together. Neighboring colors can highlight
          accents and suggest interactions, while colors further apart indicate hierarchy and
          relationships.

          We use a simplified type scale with only the essential font styles. This ensures visual
          harmony and readability without unnecessary complexity. By defining a concise set of font
          sizes, we maintain a consistent and balanced look, enhancing the user experience and
          streamlining the design process.

          Abstracting design decisions into meaningful, reusable tokens improves collaboration
          between designers and developers by providing a common language. This streamlines the
          workflow and makes design systems more efficient.

        </div>
        <p>
          Semantic tokens should address known use cases, while global tokens are available for new
          scenarios. With a shared understanding of the naming conventions for semantic tokens,
          developers can easily select the appropriate styles without needing further consultation
          with designers.

          The UI kit consists only of the components currently used in the app. No unused button
          variants or typography styles allowed.

          The behavior of components in Figma matches those in production. It is often quicker to
          experiment with Figmaâ€™s properties to design the API than having to do it all in code.

        <p>
          Colors and font styles are managed in Figma, where they are incorporated into the UI kit
          and optimized for both dark and light modes. These tokenized design elements are then
          exported and converted into specific style sheets, which can be utilized in production
          components. The tokens are stored in a shared repo on Radicle that serves as a single
          source of truth.

        <p>
          We use Tokens Studio to manage tokens in Figma and store them in a shared JSON file. From
          this JSON they get transformed automatically into separate style sheeets for easier
          management. Whenever a token gets updated, the style sheets and with them the components
          in production will also update.
        </p>
        <p>
          To minimize bloat and make maintenance easier, the documentation is attached directly to
          the tokens in the form of code comments.

          At Radicle we're building developing developer tools. It's crucial to prioritize
          readability and a clear, easy-to-understand hierarchy while keeping decorative elements to
          a minimum. However, a design system should also have character. Radicle's style pays
          homage to the barefoot developers, drawing inspiration from the aesthetics of 90s
